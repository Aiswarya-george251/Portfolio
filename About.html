          I'm an ambitious learner and aspiring technical support specialist with a background in computer science and web development. Originally from India and currently based in Canada, I bring both technical skills and strong communication abilities to every project and interaction.
          <br><br>
          My journey into tech support started with a deep interest in problem-solving and a desire to help people feel confident with technology. I have hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL â€” and Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills through certifications in Python and Data Analytics from the Knowely app.
          <br><br>
          I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from India and a Post-Graduate Diploma in Web Development from Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario. These educational experiences have helped me build a solid foundation in both logic and creativity.
          <br><br>
          Beyond the code and commands, I genuinely enjoy connecting with people. Iâ€™m creative, curious, and always eager to learn. Whether itâ€™s making a technical process easier for someone or building a small web project, I love turning ideas into meaningful solutions.
          <br><br>
          Thanks for stopping by â€” I hope my work inspires you as much as the journey has inspired me. ðŸ˜Š
